   - File size limits and error handling
   - Automatic temp file cleanup

2. **vectorize.io Integration** ✅
   - Enhanced VectorService with comprehensive mock implementation
   - Batch document processing structure
   - Vector storage and retrieval functions ready
   - Dutch legal context-aware search results

3. **Document Processing** ✅

   - Message history and context display
   - Loading states and error handling

3. **Legal Context Enhancement**
   - Dutch legal terminology awareness
   - Legal document structure understanding
   - Citation and reference handling

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Estimated: 2-3 days)
1. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design implementation
   - Performance optimization
   - Error message improvement

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Unit tests for core services
   - Integration tests for APIs
   - End-to-end testing with real documents

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Microservices pattern with separate frontend/backend
- **Database**: vectorize.io for vectors, local storage for metadata
- **Authentication**: No authentication required for single-user version
- **File Processing**: Batch processing to optimize API usage

### Pending Decisions
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 vs alternatives for chat responses
- **Styling**: CSS Modules vs Tailwind CSS for frontend styling
- **Document Storage**: Temporary vs persistent local file storage
- **Error Handling**: Detailed vs simplified error messages for users

## Known Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **API Limits**: vectorize.io rate limits may affect batch processing speed
- **File Size**: Large PDF files may require special handling
- **Memory Usage**: Need to manage memory efficiently for document processing
- **Cost Management**: Batch processing to minimize API costs

### User Experience Constraints
- **Single User**: No multi-user features or authentication
- **Local Storage**: Document metadata stored locally
- **Network Dependency**: Requires internet for all external APIs
- **Legal Context**: Dutch legal terminology and document structure
