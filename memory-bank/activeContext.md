# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Project Phase: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2
**Status**: Foundation Infrastructure Complete - Core Features Next

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Google Drive Integration**: Implement real Google Drive API authentication and file download
2. **vectorize.io Integration**: Set up actual vectorize.io API connections and document processing
3. **Document Processing**: PDF text extraction and document parsing implementation
4. **API Testing**: Test all endpoints with real API integrations

### Recent Changes
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Full project structure and basic infrastructure operational
- **Frontend Application**: Complete React app with routing, components, and styling
- **Backend API**: Express server with all routes, services, and middleware
- **Service Architecture**: Complete service layer with mock implementations
- **Development Ready**: Both frontend and backend can be started and tested

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Initialize Project Structure** ✅
   - Created frontend/ and backend/ directories
   - Set up package.json files with dependencies
   - Configured build tools (Vite for frontend, Express for backend)

2. **Environment Setup** ✅
   - Created environment configuration documentation
   - Set up API credentials management structure
   - Configured development scripts

3. **Basic Infrastructure** ✅
   - Created Express.js server with CORS configuration
   - Set up React application with basic routing
   - Implemented basic error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Core Features (Estimated: 5-7 days)
1. **Google Drive Integration**
   - Implement Google Drive API authentication
   - Create link parsing and file download functionality
   - Add file validation and processing pipeline

2. **vectorize.io Integration**
   - Set up vectorize.io API client
   - Implement batch document processing
   - Create vector storage and retrieval functions

3. **Document Processing**
   - PDF parsing and text extraction
   - Document chunking for large files
   - Metadata extraction and storage

### Phase 3: Chat Interface (Estimated: 3-4 days)
1. **RAG Implementation**
   - Vector search functionality
   - Context retrieval and ranking
   - Response generation with legal context

2. **Frontend Chat UI**
   - Real-time chat interface
   - Message history and context display
   - Loading states and error handling

3. **Legal Context Enhancement**
   - Dutch legal terminology awareness
   - Legal document structure understanding
   - Citation and reference handling

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Estimated: 2-3 days)
1. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design implementation
   - Performance optimization
   - Error message improvement

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Unit tests for core services
   - Integration tests for APIs
   - End-to-end testing with real documents

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Microservices pattern with separate frontend/backend
- **Database**: vectorize.io for vectors, local storage for metadata
- **Authentication**: No authentication required for single-user version
- **File Processing**: Batch processing to optimize API usage

### Pending Decisions
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 vs alternatives for chat responses
- **Styling**: CSS Modules vs Tailwind CSS for frontend styling
- **Document Storage**: Temporary vs persistent local file storage
- **Error Handling**: Detailed vs simplified error messages for users

## Known Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **API Limits**: vectorize.io rate limits may affect batch processing speed
- **File Size**: Large PDF files may require special handling
- **Memory Usage**: Need to manage memory efficiently for document processing
- **Cost Management**: Batch processing to minimize API costs

### User Experience Constraints
- **Single User**: No multi-user features or authentication
- **Local Storage**: Document metadata stored locally
- **Network Dependency**: Requires internet for all external APIs
- **Legal Context**: Dutch legal terminology and document structure
