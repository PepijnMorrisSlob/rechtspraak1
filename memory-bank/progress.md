- [ ] **Basic Infrastructure**: Express server and React app initialization

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] **Google Drive Integration**: API authentication and file download
- [ ] **Document Processing**: PDF parsing and text extraction
- [ ] **vectorize.io Integration**: Batch processing and vector storage
- [ ] **Metadata Management**: Document status and processing tracking

### Phase 3: RAG Implementation
- [ ] **Vector Search**: Semantic search across legal documents
- [ ] **Context Retrieval**: Relevant document section identification
- [ ] **Response Generation**: AI-powered answers with legal context
- [ ] **Chat Interface**: Real-time conversation UI

### Phase 4: User Experience
- [ ] **Frontend UI**: Modern, responsive design implementation
- [ ] **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and recovery
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimization for large document processing
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend Services (Not Started)
- **DocumentService**: Google Drive integration and file processing
- **VectorService**: vectorize.io API interactions
- **ChatService**: RAG query processing and response generation
- **BatchService**: Queue management and job processing

### Frontend Components (Not Started)
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time conversation UI
- **Document Manager**: Google Drive link input and status
- **Knowledge Base Viewer**: Document overview and system status

### External Integrations (Not Started)
- **vectorize.io**: Vector database operations
- **Google Drive API**: File access and download
- **AI Service**: Context-aware response generation

## Known Issues & Risks

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: vectorize.io and Google Drive API quotas may impact performance
- **Large Files**: PDF processing for large legal documents may require optimization
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of document processing queues
- **Cost Management**: Batch processing optimization to minimize API costs

### Development Risks
- **API Access**: Need to verify vectorize.io API access and functionality
- **Google Drive**: Authentication and file access permissions
- **Legal Context**: Ensuring proper Dutch legal terminology understanding
- **Performance**: Response time optimization for chat interactions

### No Current Blockers
- All prerequisites have been clarified
- Technology stack is confirmed and available
- API access requirements are documented
- Development environment is ready for setup

## Performance Metrics (To Be Established)

### Target Performance Goals
- **Document Processing**: < 2 minutes for typical legal PDF
- **Chat Response**: < 5 seconds for typical queries
- **Batch Processing**: Handle 10+ documents simultaneously
- **Memory Usage**: < 1GB RAM for document processing
- **API Efficiency**: Minimize vectorize.io API calls through batching

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully add documents via Google Drive links
- [ ] Documents are properly vectorized and searchable
- [ ] Chat responses are accurate and contextually relevant
- [ ] System handles legal terminology and document structure
- [ ] Batch processing works efficiently without errors

## Next Milestone

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria

- [ ] Frontend and backend applications initialized and running
- [ ] Environment configuration complete with API credentials
- [ ] Basic infrastructure operational (Express server, React app)
- [ ] Development workflow established (npm scripts, hot reload)

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (Foundation setup)
- **Phase 2**: 5-7 days (Core features)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 days (Chat interface)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days (Polish & testing)
- **Total**: 12-17 days for complete implementation
